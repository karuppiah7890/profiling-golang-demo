# profiling-golang-demo

I am using this repo to record my learnings on - how to "profile" a golang program.

Trying out the things mentioned in this blog post

In this blog post, I learning about the basics of how to do "cpu profiling". I still have to learn what "profiling"
exactly means.

I am using [this golang code](https://github.com/hundt98847/multi-language-bench/tree/master/src/havlak/go) and profiling
it like it is mentioned in the blog post.

Requirements:
go: `go version go1.11.4 darwin/amd64`
[graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

Refactored the golang code a bit to make it work with my version of golang compiler.
